# About

After working in the games industry for over 4 years, I decided it was time to switch tracks and pursue a different kind of software development. At the end of my stint at Naughty Dog I found myself building web tools with React to streamline our development process, and I really enjoyed that. One canceled multiplayer project, layoffs, and 11 freeCodeCamp certificates later I stand before you as a skilled full-stack developer. Below I have a set of featured projects that showcase my skillset ranging from front-end to back-end, and even some of my work in games.
